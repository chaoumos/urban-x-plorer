The target audience is adventurous individuals interested in discovering hidden and abandoned places in cities. The site should have a visually striking, slightly gritty, and mysterious aesthetic. Key features include a searchable map of user-submitted locations, a blog section for sharing stories and tips, a safety guidelines section, and a forum for community discussions.  Implement user accounts with the ability to upload photos and location details. The color scheme should be dark with neon accents.</p>
